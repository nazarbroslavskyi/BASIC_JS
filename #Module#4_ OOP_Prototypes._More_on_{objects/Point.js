// Point

// Write a class called Point, which represents a point in two - dimensional space.
// A point has x and y properties,
//   given as arguments to its constructor.
// It also has a single method plus, which
// takes another point and returns the sum of the two points,
//   that is, a new point whose x is the sum of the x properties of the
// two original points, and whose y is the sum of their y properties.

class Point {
  constructor(x = 0, y = 0) { // default values I set up to zero
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }

  plus({x = 0, y = 0}) {
    return new Point(this.x + x, this.y + y)
  }
}

console.log(new Point(1, 2).plus(new Point(2, 1))) // â†’ Point{x: 3, y: 3}
